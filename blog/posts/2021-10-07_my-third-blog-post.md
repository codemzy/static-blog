title: This is my third blog post and it is the most epic yet!
description: This is a description about the blog post. It will be the introductory paragraph used in search results, on blog list pages, and at the top of the blog post. It's pretty important.

I'm writing a third blog post so I can add pagination to the main blog list and the categories. This is essential for any blog that needs more than a few posts. Everything after this sentence is just a repeat of my second blog post. Not good for SEO, but this isnt public, so it will do the job for now. 

## This is the first header

I've been working on this blog builder for a couple of days now, and it's time to add another blog post so that I can build the main blog page.

I also want to see how a few things look, like

- Lists
- With 
- Bullets

and...

1. Lists 
2. With
3. Numbers

### What about a h3?

Yeah it will be cool to see how that looks too.

> I'm also wondering how a blockquote will look

The end.
