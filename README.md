# React Static


Just a template to create a really simple static site using React. Yes, I know, you can use Next.js to create static sites with React. But this is for a REALLY simple static site. Just because I like it that way.

It also comes with Tailwind installed as default for some beautiful css.

- React
- Tailwind
- Static

That's all.
